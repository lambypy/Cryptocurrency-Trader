# Cryptocurrency-Trader ðŸª™

I have been manually trading cryptocurrency for some years now, mostly for fun, but also to learn and gain more knowledge of markets. In expanding my understanding, I looked to automation of some of the strategies that I used. There is much time throughout the day where I am not available to manually trade, and this presents opportunity in cryptocurrency which the markets exist 24/7. 

Binance was my most used exchange, and since I was familiar with the API and documentation, I felt that it would be suitable to use Python. This was especially true since my strategies and not exactly relying on low latency. The code uses the Binance API to make market orders through strategies that have been backtested against previous financial market data. Some of these strategies are hidden, but I have also included some of the more basic ones that can be shown to how the code works and the whole function behind it. 

It is ideal to have these strategies as simple as possible in code, while testing everything beforehand to ensure that issues are minimal. One of the issues faced using Python, was the lack of enforcement of statically typed. This was something I had to watch out for, while also using libraries for assistance.
